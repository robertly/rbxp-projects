  This sample demonstrates the impact of cancelling a tween.

  A part is instanced in the Workspace and a tween is set up to move it along
  the Y axis. Mid way through the tween, it is cancelled. It can be observed
  here that the part does not return to its original position, but when it is
  resumed it takes the full length of the tween (5 seconds) to complete.

  This is the key difference TweenBase:Pause() and TweenBase:Cancel().
