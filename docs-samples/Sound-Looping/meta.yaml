  Whilst looping is most appropriate for longer tracks such as music or ambient
  sounds, this sample demonstrates sound looping by creating the Roblox death
  sound in every character's head and looping it.

  The Players.PlayerAdded and Player.CharacterAdded functions are used to detect
  new player characters. One a new character has been added a sound is created
  in their head. For demonstration purposes, the Sound.DidLoop function is used
  to show how the number of times a particular sound has looped can be tracked.
