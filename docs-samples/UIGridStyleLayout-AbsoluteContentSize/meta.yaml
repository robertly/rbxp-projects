  In this example a UIGridLayout is created inside of a `ScrollingFrame`. To
  make sure the `Class.ScrollingFrame.CanvasSize` is exactly the size it needs
  to be to contain the grid, a function is connected to the grids
  `Class.Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal()` to listen for when the
  AbsoluteContentSize of the grid changes, and sets the canvas size accordingly.
