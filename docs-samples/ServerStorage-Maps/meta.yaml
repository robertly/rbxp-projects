  This is a very simple example of how a multiple map system can be made using
  ServerStorage.

  It creates three dummy models (to take the place of maps), that are parented
  to ServerStorage. Then, it will load a random map (different to the previous
  map) and wait a specified duration on a loop.

  Developers wishing to integrate something similar into their games should
  consider measures to ensure players respawn correctly, or go to a lobby during
  intermission periods.
