  The code sample below creates `Tool` in the
  `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's` `Class.Backpack` that increases the
  player's `Class.Humanoid.JumpPower|JumpPower()` from `50` to `150` for 5
  seconds.

  This example uses the tool's `Class.Tool.Enabled` property as a debounce by
  setting the property to true when the player begins sprinting and to false
  when the player stops sprinting. As a result, the tool cannot be activated to
  extend the duration of the SuperJump buff until after the 5 second duration
  ends.

  Unequipping the tool also stops the player from super jumping by changing the
  JumpPower back to `50`.
