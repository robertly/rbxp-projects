  Demonstrates how the `Class.Script:GetHash()` function works
  and what a hash value looks like. Although you cannot execute the function in
  a `Script` or `LocalScript`, you can execute it via the Command Line.

  This example creates a script and sets its source to a specific string. Then, it
  prints the script's hash value, which looks like:

  ```
  c1f6c044e26b030ae057f6727b77a025
  ```

  Changing the script's source changes the hash value generated by the hash function.
