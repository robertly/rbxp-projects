  This code sample causes any `BasePart` with the tag "Deadly" to kill any
  `Humanoid` that touches it. It does this using a common pattern with
  `CollectionService`: listen for all parts with the tag, and make a connection.
  When the tag is removed, disconnect. Instead of copying the same kill script
  into many bricks, use this pattern instead!

  Try tagging a part using `CollectionService` by pasting this into the Command bar:
  `game:GetService("CollectionService"):AddTag(workspace.Part, "Deadly")`
  Then, when you press Play and touch the brick with your character they should die.
