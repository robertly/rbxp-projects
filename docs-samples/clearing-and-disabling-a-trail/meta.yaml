  This example explains how to both clear a trail's drawn segments and disable
  the trail to prevent new segments from being drawn. New segments will not be
  drawn until the trails `Class.Trail.Enabled` property is set to `true`.

  In order for this example to be properly demonstrated, we must first create a
  `BasePart` that will be the parent of our trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  To demo that the `Class.Trail:Clear()` function erases any existing trail
  segments, the example relies on `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()`
  to move _part_ back and forth to constantly draw a trail. Every 3 seconds of
  this motion, the trail segments are cleared and the trail is toggled between
  disabled and enabled.

  In order for the example to work properly, the example implements a function
  named `tweenPart` that tweens the part back and forth `15` studs.
