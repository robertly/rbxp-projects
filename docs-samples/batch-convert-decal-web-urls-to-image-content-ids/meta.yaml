  The content ID of a `Decal` on the Roblox website is associated with a `Decal`
  `Instance` rather than the actual content ID of the texture.

  The code below, will use `Class.DataModel:GetObjects()` to insert `Decal`
  objects into place and read their `Class.Decal.Texture` property to obtain the
  image content IDs.

  To use this code sample, enter the web URLs of the decals you'd like to
  convert into the array named _IMAGES_ (as strings). A dictionary with the
  converted textures will be outputted.
