  This code sample demonstrates how an `AnimationController` can be used in
  place of a `Humanoid` for non player character objects.

  A basic rig is loaded using `InsertService` and the default `Humanoid` is
  replaced with an `AnimationController`. An `AnimationTrack` is then created
  and played.
