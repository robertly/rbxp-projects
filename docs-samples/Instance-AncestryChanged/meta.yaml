display_name: Instance.AncestryChanged
description: |
  Demonstrates detecting changes to an instance's ancestry by connecting to the `Class.Instance.AncestryChanged` event.

  The ChangingPart's Parent is set to different values overtime. The parent of the part is the part's ancestor, so the `Class.Instance.AncestryChanged` event will fire whenever it changes.
