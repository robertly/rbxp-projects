  This code sample includes a simple function that uses Sound.TimeLength and
  Sound.PlaybackSpeed to play a sound that'll take the given duration to
  complete. It achieves this by setting the PlaybackSpeed of the sound to be
  equal to the TimeLength of the sound divided by the desired duration.

  Note that as TimeLength is equal to 0 when the sound has not loaded, the
  function will yield while it loads the sound.
