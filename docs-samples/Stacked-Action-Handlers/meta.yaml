  This code sample demonstrates how BindAction acts like a stack. It binds two
  actions, FirstAction (`Z`, `X`, and `C` keys) and SecondAction (`Z` and `X`
  keys) to two action handling functions. The second one will pass on a certain
  input (the `X` key).

  Both actions use the `Z` and `X` keys, however the second handler will pass
  input only if `X` is pressed. So, when `X` is pressed, the second handler is
  called and then the first. The first action is also bound to the `C` key, and
  can be triggered even though the other two inputs are "covered" by the second
  action.

  Test this code out by pasting it into a LocalScript within
  StarterPlayerScripts, then pressing `Z`, `X` and `C`. Observe which action
  handlers are called with what actions.
