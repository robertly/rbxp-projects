  This example creates a Trail with a gradient color. This means that the color
  at one end of the trail is different than the color at the opposite end of the
  trail, and both colors blend together as they get closer to the middle of the
  trail.

  In order to create this effect, we must use a `Datatype.ColorSequence` with
  two different colors. In our example, we use _blue_ and _red_ as the
  `startColor` and `endColor`.

  The gif below shows what the output of this example should look like.
