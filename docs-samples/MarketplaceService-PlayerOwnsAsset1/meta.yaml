  This code sample demonstrates how to check if a player owns a certain item.
  Here, we're checking for the item
  [Midnight Shades](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/30331986/Midnight-Shades), a
  hat that costs R$ 250. As a player enters the game, their account is checked
  for the ownership of that item and a message is printed.

  Notice how the call to PlayerOwnsAsset is wrapped in `pcall` - this prevents
  the code from throwing an error in case the player's inventory can't be
  checked for some reason. Should such an error occur, the `success` variable
  would be false.
