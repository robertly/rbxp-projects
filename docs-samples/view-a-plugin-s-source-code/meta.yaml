  If you want to view a plugin's source code without installing it, you can use
  `Class.DataModel:GetObjects()` to download the plugin. The code sample below
  includes a function that will take a plugin's website URL and insert the
  plugin into the currently selected `Instance` or the `Workspace`.

  Due to `Class.DataModel:GetObjects()|GetObjects'` security context, this
  function can only be used in the command line or in a plugin.
