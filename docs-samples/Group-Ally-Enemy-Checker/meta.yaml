  This code sample demonstrates how `GroupService` and
  `Class.Player:IsInGroup()` can be used to determine whether a player is a
  member of a group, or any of its allies or enemies.

  Note as `Class.GroupService:GetAlliesAsync()` and
  `Class.GroupService:GetEnemiesAsync()` use `StandardPages` objects a utility
  function is used to convert them to allies.
