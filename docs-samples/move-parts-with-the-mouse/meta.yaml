  The example below allows the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|local player` to move
  parts with their mouse.

  When the player presses their left mouse button over a part, that part is the
  `Class.Mouse.Target|mouse's target` and becomes the _point_. Until the player
  releases their left mouse button, that part will move to the mouse's world
  position when the player moves their mouse.

  Note that the `Class.Mouse.TargetFilter` property allows the code to ignore
  the part being moved when determining the mouse's world position.

  The code should work as expected when placed in a `LocalScript`.
