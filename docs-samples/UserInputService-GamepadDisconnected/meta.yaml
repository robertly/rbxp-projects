  The following code sample is used in the default gamepad script, so if you are
  using the default controls you do not need to worry about this. If you are
  creating a custom script for handling gamepad controls, this is a good
  template for retrieving which `Enum.UserInputType|gamepad enum` you should use
  as the primary gamepad controller.

  This code looks for the lowest numbered
  `Class.UserInputService:GetNavigationGamepad()|navigation gamepad`, and if no
  navigation gamepad is found, finds the lowest numbered
  `Class.UserInputService:GetConnectedGamepad()|connected gamepad`. If there is
  no connected gamepad, we default to gamepad1. This ensures at least some
  gamepad will be able to do controls.
