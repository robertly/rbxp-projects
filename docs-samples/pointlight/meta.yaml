  This example creates a new anchored `BasePart` named _Part_ at the position
  `{0, 0, 0}`.

  It then creates a new point light with `brightness` of 1, `Color3` `color` of
  `{255/255, 255/255, 255/255}` (white) and `range` of 16 studs. The point
  light's parent is set to the BasePart we created. To view the light, navigate
  to the part at `{0, 0, 0}` or move the _Part_ created to a location visible to
  the player.

  Please note that the properties of the created point light can easily be
  changed by modifying the property values in the code sample below.
  Additionally, if you have an existing point light, you can also create a
  similar script that modifies that light instead of creating a new BasePart and
  light.
