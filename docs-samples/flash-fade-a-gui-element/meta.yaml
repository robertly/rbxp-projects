  The example below demonstrates how to continuously fade a GUI element in and
  out (see image below). It relies on the
  `Class.RunService.RenderStepped|RenderStepped` event to update and render the
  element's `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` every frame.

  The GUI element fades in and out between the maximum transparency value,
  `MAX_TRANSPARENCY`, and minimum transparency value, `MIN_TRANSPARENCY`. It
  uses the `delta` variable to determine what amount to change the element's
  BackgroundTransparency.

  This example should work as expected when placed in a `Script` or
  `LocalScript` that is the child of the GUI element you want to fade in and
  out.
