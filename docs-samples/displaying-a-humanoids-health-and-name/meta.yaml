  This example demonstrates how to set a `Humanoid`'s
  `Class.Humanoid.DisplayerDistanceType`,
  `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance`, and
  `Class.Humanoid.NameDisplayDistance` properties. These properties determine
  how a humanoid's health bar and name are rendered for a player.

  First, we change the DisplayDistanceType to Subject using
  `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType`. When set to subject, the humanoid's Name
  and health bar will be displayed based on the humanoid's own distance settings.

  Then, the humanoid's HealthDisplayDistance is set to 0. Setting the property
  to 0 hides the health bar completely. It is not displayed at any distance.

  Finally, the humanoid's NameDisplayDistance is set to 20. This means that the
  humanoid's name will be visible to other humanoid's within 20 studs.
