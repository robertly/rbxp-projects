  This example demonstrates how to enable Gamepad navigation through a grid of
  `GuiObject|GUI` elements without manually having to connect the
  `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionUp`, `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionDown`, and
  `GuiObject|NextSelectionRight`, and `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionLeft`
  properties for every element in the grid.

  Note that this code sample assumes your `UIGridLayout` is sorted by
  `Class.UIGridLayout.SortOrder|name`, where elements are named in successive
  numerical order (see image below).

  The code relies on this to set the NextSelection properties for all
  `GuiObjects` in the same level as the UIGridLayout. In our example, the
  UIGridLayoutObject and GUI elements within the grid are all children of a
  `Frame` named _"Container"_. The code
  `Class.Instance:GetChildren()|gets the children` of _"Container"_ and loops
  through each child. Children that are not GuiObjects are ignored. For each GUI
  element, the code attempts to assigned the NextSelection properties using the
  following logic:

  1. Starting with 1, the name of all GUI elements match their position in the
     grid
  2. Left: The item to the left will always be numbered 1 less than the current
     element
  3. Right: The item to the left will always be numbered 1 more than the current
     element
  4. Up: The item above (up) will always be number of GUIs in a row 1 less than
     the current element
  5. Down: The item below (down) will always be the number of GUIs in a row more
     than the current element This logic also allows for the GUI elements at the
     begging and end of rows (excluding the first and last element) to wrap
     around to the next and previous rows. If an element doesn't exist to the
     left, right, up, or down, the NextSelection will remain nil and moving the
     Gamepad selector in the direction will not change the selected GUI.

  This example also contains code to test the grid using the arrow keys (Up,
  Down, Left, Right) of your keyboard instead of a gamepad, just in case you
  don't have a gamepad to test with. This portion of code initially selects the
  element named _"1"_ by assigning it to the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject`
  property.
