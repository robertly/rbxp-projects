  This example demos setting the transparency of a trail using a single value
  sequence `Datatype.NumberSequence`.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we set the trail's transparency to 0.8 using a single value
  sequence, which means that the transparency of the drawn segments is linear
  and constant.

  Finally, to demo the transparency the example relies on `TweenService`'s
  `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth. As the part
  moves, the trail is drawn.
