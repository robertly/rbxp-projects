  The example demonstrates how to set a player's camera movement mode.

  In this example, we set the camera movement mode to Classic via the
  `Enum.DevTouchCameraMovementMode` enum. This means that the camera of players
  on touch enabled devices will track the player but will not automatically
  rotate if the player walks left or right.
