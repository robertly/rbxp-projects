  This example demonstrates the effects of enabling and disabling a Trail
  object.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we indicate whether the trail is enabled or disabled by
  changing the color of the Trail's parent _part_. When the trail is enabled,
  _part_ is green. _Part_ is red when the trail is disabled. The enabled
  property switches every 5 seconds.

  Finally, to demo the trail's enabled state, the example relies on
  `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth.
  As the part moves, the trail is drawn or not drawn depending on the state of
  the enabled property.
