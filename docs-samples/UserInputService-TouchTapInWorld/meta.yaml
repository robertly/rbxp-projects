  This example uses the `Datatype.Vector2` position passed by
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchTapInWorld|TouchTapInWorld()` to find the
  `Datatype.Vector3` world position the user tapped. Then, the code spawns an
  anchored `BasePart|Part` at the world position.

  In order to calculate the `Datatype.Vector3` world position using the viewport
  _position_, this example generates a `Ray` called _unitRay_ originating from
  _position_ using the `Class.Camera:ViewportPointToRay()|ViewportPointToRay()`
  function. Then, since ViewportPointToRay() creates a unit ray that is only 1
  stud long, the example uses it to create a longer _ray_ that is _length_ studs
  long. Using `Class.Workspace.FindPartOnRay|FindPartOnRay()`, the code
  determines where the ray first intersects a part in the world - the Vector3
  world position that the user tapped.

  Note that the code sample will not spawn a part if the user touches on the
  screen over an empty skybox. The touch must be on a part for FindPartOnRay()
  to return a `Datatype.Vector3` position.
