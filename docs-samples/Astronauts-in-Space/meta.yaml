  This code sample uses HttpService's GetAsync to make a request to
  [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org), a web service that provides data from
  NASA. The request is made to an endpoint that provides information on how many
  astronauts are currently in space. The response is provided in JSON format, so
  it is parsed using JSONDecode. Finally, the response data is then processed
  and printed to the Output.

  Test this script by pasting the source code into a Script (HttpService cannot
  be used by LocalScripts). Also, be sure to enable HTTP Requests in your Game
  Settings (Home > Game Settings).
