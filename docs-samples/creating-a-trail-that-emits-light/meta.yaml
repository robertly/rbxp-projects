  This example demos the functionality of the light emission property of the
  trail object.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we set the light emission to 1, the maximum possible value on
  a scale from 0 to 1. While this example does not create a part, containing a
  `PointLight`, that follows the trail around, it is recommended to do so.

  Finally, to demo the trail's light emission, the example relies on
  `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth.
  As the part moves, the trail is drawn.

  The gif below demonstrates the expected output of this example.
