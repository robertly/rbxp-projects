  is provided at the top of the script by using
  `Class.Players:GetUserIdFromNameAsync()`. Then, it gets a `FriendPages` object
  by calling `Class.Players:GetFriendsAsync()` and iterates over each entry
  using the `iterPageItems` function. The username of each friend is stored in a
  table, then printed at the end.
