  The code below creates a tool in the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's`
  `Backpack` that turns the player invisible when activated and visible when
  deactivated.

  When equipped, the script simulates the tool being activated and turns the
  player invisible for 3 seconds and then simulates the tool being deactivated.
  Holding the left mouse button down turns the player invisible for up to 3
  seconds, with a cooldown period of 1 second, or until the player releases
  their left mouse button.
