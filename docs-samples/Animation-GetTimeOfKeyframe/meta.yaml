  This sample includes a function that will jump to the first keyframe of a
  specified name in an AnimationTrack.

  As AnimationTrack.TimePosition cannot be set while the animation is not
  playing the function first checks to see if the animation is playing.

  This sample will only work once an Animation has loaded.
