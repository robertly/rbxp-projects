  This example uses TweenService to animate the grapheme count in a
  typewriter-like fashion.

  The final grapheme count comes from a combination of the text object's
  `ContentText` property, which excludes style tags used for rich text, and
  `Library.utf8|utf8.len()`, which returns the grapheme count.
