  This code sample automatically removes `Accessory` objects like hats from the
  `Player`'s character when they respawn. Warning: this includes hair, so this
  script may cause acute baldness.

  When the `Class.Player.Character|Character()` is
  `Class.Player.CharacterAdded|added`, we wait for `Class.RunService.Stepped` to
  fire once (using the `wait` function of events). This is so the accessory
  removal logic runs one frame after the character spawns. A warning can appear
  if you delete accessories too quickly after the player spawns, so waiting one
  frame will avoid that.
