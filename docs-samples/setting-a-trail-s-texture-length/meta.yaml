  This example demos setting a trail's texture length.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we initially set the trail's texture length to 4 (and
  `Class.Trail.TextureMode` to _static_). Then, to demonstrate the effects of
  changing the trail length, we alternate between a trail length of 2 and 4
  every 5 seconds by adding and subtracting 2 from the length. This example uses
  the [pawprint](https://www.roblox.com/library/909814149/Paw-Prints) image as
  its `Class.Trail.Texture`.

  Finally, to demo the texture mode the example relies on `TweenService`'s
  `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth. As the part
  moves, the trail is drawn.
