  The function in the following code sample provides an example of how the
  AnimationTrack.KeyframeReached event can be used to link different effects to
  an animation.

  The function listens for any animations being played on the Humanoid (or
  AnimationController), and when a new animation is played listens for a
  keyframe named 'Effect' being reached. When a keyframe named 'Effect' is
  reached some basic particles will be emitted. Once the animation has stopped
  the connections used by the function are disconnected, in line with best
  practice to avoid memory leaks.

  Although the particle effect in this sample is very simple, it could be
  substituted for a range of more complicated effects using the Sound, Beam,
  ParticleEffect or other objects. Additionally, in many cases the developer may
  only care about effects on one specific animation (rather than every animation
  played on a Humanoid). In this case, only the KeyframeReached portion of this
  sample would be needed.
