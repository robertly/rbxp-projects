  This example creates a binoculars script that decreases the player's
  `Class.Camera.FieldOfView|FieldOfView()` and
  `Class.UserInputService.MouseDeltaSensitivity|MouseDeltaSensitivity()` when a
  player with a `Class.UserInputService.MouseEnabled|MouseEnabled()` left mouse
  clicks. The script also points the player's `Camera` towards the
  `Datatype.Vector3` world position of the mouse click determined by the
  `Class.Mouse|Mouse's` `Class.Mouse.Hit|Mouse.Hit.p` property.

  When the player left mouse clicks again, the player's camera reverts back to
  the a custom `Enum.CameraType` with the same field of view and
  `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame()` as before the player zoomed in with the script.

  While the player uses the binoculars, the script locks the player's mouse to
  the center of the screen by setting the player's
  `Enum.UserInputType.MouseBehavior|MouseBehavior()` to LockCenter. The player's
  camera moves when the player moves their mouse according to the
  `Class.InputObject.Delta` property passed by
  `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged|InputChanged()` indicating the mouse's
  `Datatype.Vector2` change in screen position.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it should be placed in a
  `LocalScript`.
