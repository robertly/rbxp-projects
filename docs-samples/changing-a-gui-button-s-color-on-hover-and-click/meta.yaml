  The code below enables a button's `Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor` as long as
  it it not a `ImageButton` with `Class.ImageButton.HoverImage` and
  `Class.ImageButton.PressedImage` properties set to images.

  In order for the code to work as expected, it must be placed in a
  `LocalScript` that is a child of the button.
