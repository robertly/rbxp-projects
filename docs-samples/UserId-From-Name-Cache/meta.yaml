  This code sample demonstrates using the
  `Class.Players:GetUserIdFromNameAsync()` method to get a user's
  `Class.Player.UserId` from their `Class.Player.Name`. Because
  `Class.Players:GetUserIdFromNameAsync()|GetUserIdFromNameAsync()` yields, you
  can avoid calling it for the same `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` using a table
  to store each `Name`:`UserId` pair found, called a `cache`.
  `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` is used to catch the failure in case the `UserId`
  doesn't exist.
