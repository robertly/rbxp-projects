  This code sample attempts to retrieve a `Translator` object for the local
  player. `Class.LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForPlayerAsync()` is wrapped
  in a pcall because it may error. If it does not error and returns a
  Translator, it translates and prints "Hello World!" in the player's language.
  If the function errors, it prints "GetTranslatorForLocaleAsync failed:"
  followed by the error message.

  `Class.LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForPlayer()` can also be used if you'd
  like to get the player's translator without yielding until the function
  returns.
