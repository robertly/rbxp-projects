  Buttons are a great way to get input from the user. Let's change our plugin so
  that it adds a button to the Studio toolbar which inserts a new script into
  the game.

  First, we need to make a toolbar to hold the button. For that, we'll use the
  `Class.Plugin:CreateToolbar()` function. We can then call the
  `Class.Toolbar:CreateButton()` function on that object to insert a custom
  button for the plugin.

  1. Open the <b>EmptyScriptAdder</b> script and delete `print("Hello world!")`.
  2. Copy and paste <b>Part 1</b> of the code sample into the script:
  3. Save the plugin as before (right-click the script and select <b>Save as
     Local Plugin</b>). After this you'll see the button in the **Plugins** tab
     of Studio.

  4. The button doesn't do anything yet, so let's add some new code to have the
     button insert a `Script` instance and use the `Class.Script.Source`
     property to change its default content. Copy and paste <b>Part 2</b> of the
     code sample into the script.

  5. Once again, save the plugin through <b>Save as Local Plugin</b>. Now if you
     click the <b>Add Script</b> plugin button, it will insert a new `Script`
     into **ServerScriptService**. Best of all, the new script doesn't have the
     `print("Hello world!")` command at the top!
