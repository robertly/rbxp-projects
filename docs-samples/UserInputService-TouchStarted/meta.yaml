  This example demonstrates how to use touch input events to drag a GUI element
  while a player touches and drags across their screen.

  The touch `InputObject` is the same input object throughout the lifetime of
  the touch. So comparing input objects when they are touch objects is valid to
  determine if it is the same touch as the input starts, changes, and ends.

  The example starts tracking a drag once the touch is registered by the
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchStarted|TouchStarted()` event. It continues to
  update as that touch moves, tracking it's position relative to start position
  to move a GUI until a `Class.UserInputService.TouchStarted|TouchEvent` event
  fires for that touch.
