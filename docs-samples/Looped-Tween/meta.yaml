  This code sample includes an example of how a looped tween can be created.

  A part is instanced in the Workspace, and a Tween is created using
  TweenService:Create that is set to animate it's position along the Y axis. The
  looped effect is achieved by modifying the TweenInfo used in
  TweenService:Create. Specifically, when RepeatCount is set to be less than 0
  the tween will play indefinitely. Also, setting Reverses to true will cause
  the tween to play in reverse once it has reached it's destination. In
  combination this creates a looped effect.

  The correct way to make a tween play indefinitely is to set RepeatCount to -1.
  Developers should avoid using large numbers (or math.huge) as a substitute as
  this is unstable and may stop working at any point.
