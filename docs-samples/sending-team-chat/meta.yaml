  This example demonstrates that the `Class.Players:TeamChat()` function
  executes without error if using the Command Bar or a Plugin and errors if
  executed in a `LocalScript`.

  When executed in the Command Bar, the function sends the specified message to
  all players on the same `Team` as the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`.
