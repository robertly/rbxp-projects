  This example demonstrates how to ignore user input when any `TextBox` is
  focused. When a player is not focusing on any TextBox, pressing the _jumpKey_
  (`Enum.KeyCode|J Key`) change's their humanoid's
  `Enum.HumanoidStateType|state` to Jumping using the
  `Class.Humanoid:ChangeState()` function to make their character jump.

  When the player is focusing on any TextBox, the player will not jump. The
  example checks if any TextBox is focused by checking if the
  `Class.UserInputService.GetFocusedTextbox` function returns `nil` instead of a
  TextBox instance.

  This connects to the `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged` event to determine when the
  player is jumping and prevent the player from using the jumpKey to jump while
  already jumping.
