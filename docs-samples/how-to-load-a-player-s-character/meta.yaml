  This example demonstrates the `Class.Player:LoadCharacterBlocking()` function.

  First, the script changes the local player's appearance by changing the
  `Class.Player.CharacterAppearance` property to the _userId_ 772462. Then, the
  script fires the LoadCharacterBlocking function to reload the player's
  character with the new appearance.

  This function can't be used in scripts, but is usable in the command bar. As
  such, this example will only work as expected when fired from the command bar.

  Since this function executes asynchronously, the script will not continue
  execution until the function finishes.
