  This rather lengthy code sample shows how every property of a
  `ParticleEmitter` can be set, including `Datatype.NumberRange`,
  `Datatype.NumberSequence` and `Datatype.ColorSequence` properties. Below is
  how the ParticleEmitter should after every property is set. Try playing around
  with the different properties to customize how the effect looks!
