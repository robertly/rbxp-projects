  This sample includes a simple function to change the texture of the `Shirt`
  and `Pants` worn by a player's character. If shirt and pants don't exist then
  they are created. Note, this should be run every time the character spawns. If
  a developer is looking to permanently change a character's appearance to a
  preset it is recommended they use `Class.Player.CharacterAppearance`.
