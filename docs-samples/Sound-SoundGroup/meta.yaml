  This sample demonstrates how a SoundGroup can be used to change the volume of
  its associated Sounds and apply SoundEffects.

  In this example a Sound is instanced in the Workspace and assigned to a new
  SoundGroup. The Sound is played and during playback the volume is changed via
  the SoundGroup and a SoundEffect is added.
