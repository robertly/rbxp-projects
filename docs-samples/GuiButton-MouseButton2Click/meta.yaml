display_name: GUI Button Right Click
description: |
  Demonstrates how to use the `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton2Click` event to detect when a user right clicks a `Class.GuiButton`.

  The mouse has to be in bounds of the button and has to be pressed down and up again before this event fires.

  Note: place the "RightClickScreenGui" within StarterGui for this sample to work properly.
