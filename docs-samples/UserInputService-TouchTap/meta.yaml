  The code sample below demonstrates the difference between a
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchTap|TouchTap()` and
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchLongPress|TouchLongPress()` by creating a
  `GuiObject|GUI` `Frame` that appears when user touches the screen of their
  device and disappears when the `Class.UserInputEvent.TouchEnded|touch ends`.
  When the long press event fires, the GUI doubles in size. Also, the GUI moves
  to stay centered under the user's finger when the player moves their finger.

  In order for the `Class.UserInputService.TouchLongPress|TouchLongPress()` to
  fire, the user touch the screen and hold their finger still for a short period
  of time. Once the touch moves, the long press event will not fire.

  In order for the example to work as expected, it should be placed in a
  `LocalScript` that is parented to a `ScreenGui`.
