  The code sample below prints "This tool requires a handle!' when the tool
  requires a handle to function, and "This tool does not require a handle!' when
  the tool does not require a handle to function.

  In order for code to function as expected, the `tool` variable must be set to
  a `Tool` instance in the game or in a `Player|Player's` `Backpack`.

  Although this example demonstrates how to determine the value of the
  `Class.Tool.RequiresHandle` property, the property is usually set manually
  within Studio mode when you create a tool, rather than via a script.
