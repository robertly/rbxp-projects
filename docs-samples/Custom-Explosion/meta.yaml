  This sample contains a simple function that creates a custom explosion. The
  custom explosion will not break joints as Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent
  is equal to 0. This means Humanoids will not be instantly killed as their neck
  joints are broken. In this example explosion.BlastPressure is equal to zero so
  as not to apply force or damage terrain but this can be changed.

  The Explosion.Hit event is used to listen for contact. Once contact has been
  made the code will look for the parent model of the BasePart hit by the
  explosion. If that model exists, hasn't already been damaged and has a
  Humanoid in it damage will be applied based on distance from the explosion's
  origin.
