  This code sample will cause players to respawn at the same place they died. It
  does this by keeping track of where the player despawned using
  `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving`. Note that the player's location is saved
  on-despawn, not on-death. This can be problematic if the player falls off a
  ledge and dies due to `Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight` - their
  respawn position won't be saved in this case.

  It's also important to note the need to "forget" the location of players who
  leave the game. We use `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved` on `Players` instead of
  `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`. This is because PlayerRemoving fires before
  CharacterRemoving - and we need to make sure we don't forget the player's
  respawn location then immediately remember a new one (this is a memory leak;
  potentially many players could visit, respawn and leave). So, we use
  ChildRemoved on Players so the event fires after the character is removed.
