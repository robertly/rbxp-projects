display_name: Creating a Path with Pathfinding Service
description: |
  Demonstrates creating a path using `Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()`

  'PathOptions' represents a Model with three paths made of different materials.
  When creating the path we define a large 'Cost' for two of the three paths materials.
  This will ensure the path created steers towards the path with the material of the lowest 'Cost'.

  Once the path is created, small parts are created at each waypoint to visualize the path.
