  This code sample includes a simple example of how to re-balance teams. When
  Team.AutoAssignable is set to true players will be added to Teams in a
  balanced fashion. However as Players leave the game this can lead to
  unbalanced teams as players are not reallocated. This code keeps track of the
  number of players in each team and, when players leave will check to see if
  the teams need re-balancing.
