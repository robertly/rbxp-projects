"description": |
  This `LocalScript` code waits for the local player's `Humanoid` object to
  load, then it creates a new `Animation` instance with the proper
  `Class.Animation.AnimationId`. The animation is then loaded onto the humanoid,
  creating an `AnimationTrack`, and the track is played with
  `Class.AnimationTrack:Play()`. Following that, the
  `Class.AnimationTrack:GetMarkerReachedSignal()` function detects when the
  "KickEnd" marker is hit.
