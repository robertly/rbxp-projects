"description": "This code sample uses `UrlEncode` to turn a string into a safe,\n\
  [percent-encoded][1] string that can be used in a URL as an argument. Notice\nhow\
  \ only unreserved characters (letters, numbers and `-_.~`) are not\ntransformed\
  \ into percent-encoded equivalents. Characters with accents are also\ntransformed\
  \ (for example `\xE9` is transformed into `%C3`).\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding\n"
