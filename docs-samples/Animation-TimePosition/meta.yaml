  The following code sample includes two functions that demonstrate how
  AdjustSpeed and TimePosition can be used to freeze an animation at a
  particular point.

  The first function freezes an animation at a particular point in time (defined
  in seconds). The second freezes at it at a percentage (between 0 or 100) by
  multiplying the percentage by the track length.

  As TimePosition can not be used when an AnimationTrack is not playing, the
  functions check to make sure the animation is playing before proceeding.
