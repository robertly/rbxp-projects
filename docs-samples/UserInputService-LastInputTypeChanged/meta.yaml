  This example hides the mouse icon while the player beings using their
  keyboard, such as to chat or enter text into a `TextBox`. The mouse icon
  reappears when the user resumes mouse input.

  This uses the `Enum.UserInputType.LastInputType|LastInputType()` event to
  determine when the user begins keyboard input and mouse input - based on the
  value of the `Enum.UserInputType|lastInputType` argument.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it should be placed in a
  `Class.LocalScript`.
