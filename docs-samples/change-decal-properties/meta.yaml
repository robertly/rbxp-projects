display_name: Changing a Decal Properties
description: |
  Demonstrates three examples of changes to a `Class.Decal` instance by setting its properties. 

  First the decal will alternate between two different images by setting the value of the `Class.Decal.Texture` property to alternate image asset ID.

  Then the decal's image will change colors by setting the value of the `Class.Decal.Color3` property.

  Finally the image will become increasingly transparent by increasing its `Class.Decal.Transparency` value until it is fully transparent.
