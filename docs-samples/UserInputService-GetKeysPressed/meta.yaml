  This example demonstrates how to use the
  `Class.UserInputService:GetKeysPressed()` function to create a combo action
  where the player double jumps when the player presses _actionKey_ key
  (Left Shift) + Jump key (Spacebar).

  The _actionKey_ variable indicates which key, combined with the Jump key,
  needs to be pressed for the player to double jump.

  When the player presses the Jump key, the
  `Class.UserInputService.JumpRequest|JumpRequest()` event is invoked, which is
  connected to the script's _jumpRequest_ function. If the Left Shift key is
  pressed and the player is not already in the middle of a jump, this function
  sets the _canDoubleJump_ boolean to _true_.

  The example connects the _stateChanged_ function to the
  `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged|StateChanged()` event so that the function fires
  when their `Enum.HumanoidStateType|humanoid's state` changes. If the state
  changes from Jumping to Freefall, and the _canDoubleJump_ boolean is _true_,
  the function makes the player jump again by setting their humanoid's state
  back to Jumping using the `Class.Humanoid:ChangeState()|ChangeState()`
  function . The example also uses the _canJump_ boolean variable to determine
  when the player is in the middle of a jump. Without this variable, the player
  could press the _actionKey_ + Jump Key (spacebar) to jump endlessly without
  landing. When the boolean is true, the player is not jumping. If the player is
  not jumping, _jumpRequest()_ checks if the _actionKey_ is pressed and sets
  _canJump_ to false. When the player lands, _stateChanged()_ sets the variable
  to true.
