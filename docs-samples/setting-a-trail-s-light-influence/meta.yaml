  This example demos the trail's light influence property.

  In order to do this, we must first set `Lighting`'s
  `Class.Lighting.Brightness` to 0. This is done to create a better demo
  lighting to demo the differences in the trail's appearance when the light
  influence property changes.

  Next, we create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we initially set the LightInfluence property to _1_. Then,
  every 5 seconds we increment the property so that it toggles between _0_ and
  _1_. When the value is _0_, the trail appears much brighter because it is not
  influenced by Lighting's low brightness as compared to when the value is _1_.

  Finally, to demo the property the example relies on `TweenService`'s
  `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth. As the part
  moves, the trail is drawn.
