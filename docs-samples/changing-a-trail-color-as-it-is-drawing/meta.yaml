  This example changes the color of the trail as it is being drawn. Initially,
  the color of the trail is set to blue (`Color3.new(0,255,255)`). After waiting
  for _1.5_ seconds, the color of the trail is set to red
  (`Color3.new(255,0,0)`).

  The gif below displays what the output of the example should look like.
