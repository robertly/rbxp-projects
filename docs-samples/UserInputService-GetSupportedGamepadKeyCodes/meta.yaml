  This example gets a list of navigation gamepads and a list of their supported
  `Enum.KeyCodes`. Then, it iterates through the supported KeyCode list and
  binds the _ButtonX_ and _X_ keys to functions if they are supported by a
  gamepad using the
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|ContextActionService`.
