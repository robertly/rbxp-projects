  The code sample below demonstrates how to use the
  `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton1Up` and `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton1Down` events
  to handle user input when the left mouse button is pressed down and released
  up on a `GuiButton`.

  For the example to work expected, the `LocalScript` containing the code should
  be a child of the GUI button.
