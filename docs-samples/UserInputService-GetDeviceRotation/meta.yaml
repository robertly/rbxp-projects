  This example prints the current CFrame of a players device. Note that this
  will only work as expected if the player's device has an enabled gyroscope. If
  not, the example prints:

  > _Cannot get device rotation because device does not have an enabled
  > gyroscope!_
"display_name": |-
  Print Device Rotation
"expected_output": |-
  *Note:* CFrame value may differ
  ```
  CFrame: { 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 }
