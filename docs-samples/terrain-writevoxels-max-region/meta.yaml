  Many terrain methods throw an error if their given region size is too large.
  The limit is currently 4194304 voxels^3 for ReadVoxels() and WriteVoxels(),
  and 67108864 voxels^3 for other methods. For methods that take a cframe + size
  combination (e.g. FillBlock, FillCylinder etc.), then the region volume is
  calculated from the AABB of the target area.
