  This code sample loads two animations onto the local player's Humanoid and
  demonstrates how the fadeTime paramater in AnimationTrack.Play determines how
  long it takes for an AnimationTrack's WeightCurrent to reach it's
  WeightTarget.

  As WeightCurrent and WeightTarget are floats the == operator cannot be used to
  compare, instead it is more appropriate to check that the difference between
  them is sufficiently small to assume the weight fade has completed.
