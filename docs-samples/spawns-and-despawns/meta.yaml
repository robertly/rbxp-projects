  This code sample demonstrates the usage of `Class.Players.PlayerAdded`,
  `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` and `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving` in order to
  detect the spawning and despawning of players' characters. You can use this as
  a boilerplate script to make changes to players' characters as they spawn,
  such as changing `Class.Humanoid.WalkSpeed`.
