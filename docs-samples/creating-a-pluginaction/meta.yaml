"description": "This code sample visualizes how to create a `PluginAction`. Plugin\
  \ actions\nmust be created using the `Class.Plugin:CreatePluginAction()` function\
  \ in\norder to work.\n\nIn order to work as expected, the code block must but pasted\
  \ into the command\nbar, but only once. Consecutive attempts at executing the code\
  \ in the command\nbar will result in an error because a plugin cannot create more\
  \ than one\nPluginAction with the same id.\n\nAfter executing the code, the newly\
  \ created action can be assigned a keyboard\nshortcut under `File \u2192 Advanced\
  \ \u2192 Customize Shortcuts\u2026`, and can also be added\nto the Quick Access\
  \ Toolbar.\n\n![File \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Customize Shortcuts\u2026](/assets/legacy/Screen_Shot_2019-06-24_at_9.16.27_PM.png)\n\
