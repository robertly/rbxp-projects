  The example below demonstrates what a script's `Class.Script.Source` property is.
  Although you cannot reference a script's source from within a `Script` or `LocalScript`,
  you can reference it via the Command Line.
  
  This example creates a script and sets its source to a specific string. It parents the script to
  Workspace so you can also open it in the script editor and see that the contents match what it was set to.
  Then, it prints out the value of the script's source, and the output matches the string it was set to.
