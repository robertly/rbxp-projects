  This code sample includes an example of how Tween.Completed can be used to
  determine if a Tween has been successfully completed, or cancelled.

  In this case a part is instanced and tweened towards 0, 0, 0. Once the tween
  has completed, if the final PlaybackState is Completed then the part will
  explode. Were the tween to be cancelled prior to completion, the explosion
  would not be created.

  This method can be used to link tweens to other effects, or even chain several
  tweens to play after each other.
