  This example demonstrates how to disable loading a player's character
  appearance. Instead, the player loads as a grey model without any hats,
  shirts, pants, etc.

  This is useful for games using custom clothing and accessories.

  _Note:_ If the character has already spawned, this change will not take affect
  until the player respawns or the ``Class.Player:LoadCharacter()` function is
  called.
