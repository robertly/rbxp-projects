  This sample demonstrates how the Sound.Playing property can be used to start
  and stop playback of a sound.

  A sound is instanced in the Workspace and playback is started by setting
  Sound.Playing to true. After ten seconds the playback is stopped by setting
  Sound.Playing to false. When the playback is again resumed using Sound.Playing
  it resumes at the previous Sound.TimePosition it was stopped at. This is
  demonstrated by printing the TimePosition property immediately after resuming
  the sound.
