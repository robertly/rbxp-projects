  The code sample below creates a GUI `Frame` that acts as a canvas that can be
  drawn on and cleared.

  It uses two `UserInputService` events, `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan` and
  `Class.UserInputService.InputEnded` to determine when the user's left mouse
  button is down. These events set the `hold` variable so that the `paint`
  function only draws a new pixel if the user's left mouse button is pressed.

  When the user's mouse moves on the canvas, the pointer GUI moves to follow the
  mouse and, if the `hold` is true, clones the pointer to draw a new pixel onto
  the canvas at the pointer's location. The pointer's visibility is set to false
  when the mouse exits the GUI and to true when the mouse enters the GUI.

  Pressing the clear button destroys all Canvas children named "Pixel" to clear
  the canvas.
