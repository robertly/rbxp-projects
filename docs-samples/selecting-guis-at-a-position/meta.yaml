  All GUIs returned by `Class.BasePlayerGui:GetGuiObjectsAtPosition()` are
  'cloned' by the `highlightAsFrame()` local function, which creates a `Frame`
  GUI positioned on top of the specified GUI that is semi-transparent and the
  same `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize` and `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition`.

  These highlights are added to the HighlightsContainer `ScreenGui` in the
  Highlight folder of the player's PlayerGui folder. Both are created by the
  code sample. All highlight GUIs are `Class.Instance:Destroy()`ed every time
  `highlightGui()` executes.

  Note that HighlightContainer's `Class.ScreenGui.DisplayOrder` is 99999, a
  large number, so that it is unlikely any other GUI will render on top of the
  highlight GUIs.
