  This code sample creates two plugin widget windows: a drag source and a drop
  target. In the source window, the script creates a `TextBox` and `TextButton`
  to allow the user to begin a plugin drag action. The drop target window will
  display the MimeType of whatever is dragged into it using a `TextLabel`. If
  the MimeType is text/plain, it will display the plain text data instead.
  Pictured below is an animation of the drag and drop action.

  To run this code sample as a plugin, paste it into a `Script`. Then,
  right-click the script in the Explorer window and choose "Save as Local
  Plugin".
