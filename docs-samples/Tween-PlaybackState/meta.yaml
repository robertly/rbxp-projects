  In this example a part is rotated by a Tween back and forth several times. The
  TweenInfo in this case is configured to make the tween repeat twice after the
  first playback and pause between each playback. A function is connected to
  when the tween's PlaybackState changes. When run, this function will fire
  whenever the tween starts, pauses between playback, and ends.
