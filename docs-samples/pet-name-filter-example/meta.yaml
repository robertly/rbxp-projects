  This code sample includes a simple demonstration of how
  `Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()` should be implemented in a system
  where players are allowed to name their pets.

  Note, this code sample includes the server-side implementation only (to be
  placed in a `Script`). Examples of how to implement the client-side of this
  system are included under the `RemoteEvent` and `RemoteFunction` examples.
