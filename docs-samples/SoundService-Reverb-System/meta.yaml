  The code in this sample, when ran from a `LocalScript`, will change the
  `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb` property of `SoundService` when the player
  is inside a `BasePart` tagged using `CollectionService`.

  To add or remove tags and reverb types, change the entries in the 'reverbTags'
  table.
