  GetMouseDelta returns the current change in movement of the mouse as a
  Vector2, but only if the mouse is locked. If the mouse isn't locked the values
  in the returned Vector2 will be zero. It measures any mouse movement in pixels
  from the last render step to the current render step. If the user has set
  their camera sensitivity to be higher or lower than 1 in the in-game menu this
  will affect the value returned by GetMouseDelta. The camera sensitivity is a
  multiplier to the amount the camera moves as a result of mouse input.
