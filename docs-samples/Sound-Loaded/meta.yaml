  This simple function will verify a Sound has loaded by checking the
  Sound.IsLoaded property. If Sound.IsLoaded is false it will wait for the
  Loaded event before resuming.

  It is important to check Sound.IsLoaded before connecting to the Sound.Loaded
  event, as if the sound has already loaded the Sound.Loaded event will not fire
  and the function will yield indefinitely.
