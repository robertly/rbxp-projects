  This code sample demonstrates the usage of the `Class.GuiObject:TweenSize()`
  function. It initiates an animation on the parent's `Class.GuiObject.Size`
  property to `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)`, which is half the `GuiObject`'s
  parent size on both axes.

  Additionally, it demonstrates how the callback parameter can be used to detect
  when the tween stops (whether it was cancelled by another tween or completed).
