  The code below demonstrates the functionality of several `Tool` events,
  including `Class.Tool.Activated`, `Class.Tool.Deactivated`, and
  `Class.Tool.Unequipped`.

  The code, when placed in a `LocalScript` in the
  `StarterPlayer`.`StarterCharacterScripts` folder inserts and controls a tool
  in the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's` `Class.Backpack` that allows
  the player to fly through the sky when used.

  In order to ensure that the player stops flying when the player unequips the
  tool, the code uses the tool's Unequipped event to turn set the `fly` boolean
  to true and turn stop flying until the tool is reequipped and activated again.
