  This code sample is for a studio `Plugin`. The plugin creates a
  `PluginToolbarButton` which randomizes the
  `Class.BasePart.BrickColor|BrickColor()` of each selected part using
  `BrickColor.random()`. Furthermore, the button is only enabled if at least one
  part is selected. It does this by detecting changes in the `Selection` using
  `Class.Selection.SelectionChanged`.
