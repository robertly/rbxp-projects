"description": "\u200BThe example demonstrates how to set a player's camera minimum\
  \ and maximum\nzoom distance.\n\nIn this example, we set the `Class.Player.CameraMinZoomDistance`\
  \ and\n`Class.Player.CameraMaxZoomDistance` to set the min and max distance in studs\n\
  a player's camera can be from their character.\n\nNote that since the example attempts\
  \ to set the CameraMinZoomDistance to be\ngreater than the CameraMaxZoomDistance,\
  \ the CameraMinZoomDistance value will\nbe decreased and set to the value of the\
  \ max zoom distance.\n\nTo change the default min and max zoom distance values for\
  \ a player when they\nfirst enter the game, you can change the\n`StarterClass.Player.CameraMinZoomDistance`\
  \ and\n`StarterClass.Player.CameraMaxZoomDistance` properties.\n"
