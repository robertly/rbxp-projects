  This example demonstrates how to map a `Enum.UserInputType|gamepad's` states
  to their corresponding `Enum|KeyCode|KeyCodes`, and then you can always
  reference them. Since the states are mutable; you don't have to keep calling
  GetGamepadState once they are mapped. Then, you can reference the states of
  the gamepad's controls using KeyCodes and indices - such as to poll the
  Thumbstick1 position.
