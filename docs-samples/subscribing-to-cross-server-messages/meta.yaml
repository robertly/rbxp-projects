  This example demonstrates how to use `Class.MessagingService:SubscribeAsync()`
  to listen to a topic for cross-server chat within a game universe.

  When a player joins, the example subscribes to the topic
  _player-<player.UserId>_. When a message is sent with this topic, the
  connected callback executes and prints _Received message for <player.Name">_.
  It also disconnects the connection when the player's
  `Class.Player.AncestryChanged|ancestry changes`.

  In order for this to work as expected it must be placed in a server `Script`.
