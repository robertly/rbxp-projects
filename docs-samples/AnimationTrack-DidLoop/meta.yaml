  The function in this code sample will play an AnimationTrack on a loop, for a
  specific number of loops, before stopping the animation.

  In some cases the developer may want to stop a looped animation after a
  certain number of loops have completed, rather than after a certain amount of
  time. This is where the DidLoop event can be used.
