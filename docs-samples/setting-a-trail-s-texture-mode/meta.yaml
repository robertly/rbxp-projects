  This example demos setting a trail's texture mode.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we set the trail's texture mode to _static_. Note that this
  is just one of three possible modes, and that the example below can easily be
  changed to use another mode. We also set the texture of the trail to a
  [pawprint](https://www.roblox.com/library/909814149/Paw-Prints) image.

  Finally, to demo the texture mode the example relies on `TweenService`'s
  `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth. As the part
  moves, the trail is drawn.
