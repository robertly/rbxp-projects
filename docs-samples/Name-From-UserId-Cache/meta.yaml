  This code sample demonstrates using the
  `Class.Players:GetNameFromUserIdAsync()` method to get a user's
  `Class.Player.Name` from their `Class.Player.UserId`. Because
  `Class.Players:GetNameFromUserIdAsync()|GetNameFromUserIdAsync()` yields, you
  can avoid calling it for the same `Class.Player.Name|Name` using a table to
  store each `UserId`:`Name` pair found, called a `cache`.
  `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` is used to catch the failure in case the `Name`
  doesn't exist.
