  The following code sample is an example of how teleport data can be retrieved
  on the server using `Class.Player:GetJoinData()`. This code, when ran in a
  `Script` in `ServerScriptService`, will listen for new `Player|Players`
  joining the game. When they join it will retrieve their teleport data
  (verifying it came from a valid place) to find their current level.
