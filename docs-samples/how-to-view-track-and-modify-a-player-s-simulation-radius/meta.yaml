  This example demonstrates how to view, track, and modify a player's simulation
  radius.

  The example modifies and tracks this property for the
  `Class.Player.LocalPlayer`. First, the `Class.Player.MaximumSimulationRadius`
  is set to 800, which is less than the default 1000 studs.

  Next, the `Class.Player.SimulationRadius` property alternated between
  incrementing and decrementing by 20 students every 5 seconds. This is done to
  highlight the effects of changing the radius, most notable when the radius is
  draw by the physics engine when `Class.PhysicsSettings.AreRegionsShown` is
  enabled.

  Lastly, the `Class.Player.SimulationRadiusChanged` function fires when the
  radius changes and prints the updated radius.

  In order to view the simulation radius,
  `Class.PhysicsSettings.AreRegionsShown` must be set to _true_. It can be found
  under the Physics tab in Roblox Studio's settings menu.
