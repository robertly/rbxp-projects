  The following code would send everyone in the current game to a reserved
  server. Since reserved servers can only be joined by using
  `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer()`, nobody will join the
  reserved server afterwards.

  Mind that, since everyone will be teleported, the current server will
  (probably) shutdown as nobody would be left in it.
