  This code sample moves a GuiObject in a circle within its parent object using
  RunService's BindToRenderStep. It defines a parametric equation in a function
  to help with positioning the GuiObject.

  To try this code out, put a ScreenGui in the StarterGui. Inside the ScreenGui,
  insert a Frame with a LocalScript. Paste this code into the LocalScript, then
  play the game. Watch the Frame travel counterclockwise within.
