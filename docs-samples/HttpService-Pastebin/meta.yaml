  Pastebin.com is a website that allows users to paste text (usually source
  code) for others to view publicly. This code sample uses HttpService PostAsync
  and the pastebin web API to automatically create a new public paste on the
  website. Since pastebin's API is designed to take data in as a URL encoded
  string, the code uses a for-loop to turn the `dataFields` table into a URL
  encoded string, such as hello=world&foo=bar. This is used as the HTTP POST
  data.

  Test this code by first going to
  [pastebin.com/api#1](https://pastebin.com/api#1) and getting an API key
  (you'll need a pastebin account to do this). Then, paste your unique developer
  API key into the field `api_dev_key` in the code sample's `dataFields` table.
  Fill in any other information about the post you want to make, then run this
  code in a Script (not a LocalScript). If all goes well, you'll get a URL to
  your new paste in the Output window (or some error string from pastebin).
