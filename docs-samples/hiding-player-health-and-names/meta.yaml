  This example demonstrates how to hide other `Humanoid`'s (`Player` and NPC)
  health bars and names.

  This is done by setting the player's `Class.Player.HealthDisplayDistance` and
  `Class.Player.NameDisplayDistance` properties to 0.

  If you would like to display health bars and names, you set the properties to
  a value greater than 0. For instance, setting the properties to 100 means that
  the player will see other player's health and names up to 100 studs away.

  To modify the default values for players, you can change the values of the
  `StarterClass.Player.HealthDisplayDistance` and
  `StarterClass.Player.NameDisplayDistance` properties.
