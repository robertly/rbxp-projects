  The example below creates a custom scrolling frame using a `Frame` to mimic a
  `ScrollingFrame` using the `Class.GuiObject.MouseWheelForward` and
  `Class.GuiObject.MouseWheelBackward`.

  The example works by moving a Frame that is the child of our
  **CustomScrollingFrame** and parent to the `TextBox|TextBoxes`. Thus, we use a
  Frame to act as a container for the GUI elements we want to scroll. The script
  adjust's the `Datatype.UDim2` **Y** scale position of the Frame between 0 and
  -1 when the user scroll's their mouse forward and backward to mimic the
  scrolling of a traditional ScrollingFrame element.

  Although this is a simple application of the MouseWheel events, it can be
  expanded upon for more complex `GuiObject|GUI` layouts and interaction such as
  custom ScrollingFrames that scroll at different rates or with different
  elasticity.

  The gif below demonstrates the expected functionality of the code based on the
  GUI layout also shown below.
