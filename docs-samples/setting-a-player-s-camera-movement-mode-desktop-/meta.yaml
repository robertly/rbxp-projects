  The example demonstrates how to set a player's camera movement mode for
  players on a computer.

  In this example, we set the camera movement mode to Classic via the
  `Enum.DevComputerCameraMovementMode` enum. This means that the camera of
  players on touch enabled devices will track the player but will not
  automatically rotate if the player walks left or right.
