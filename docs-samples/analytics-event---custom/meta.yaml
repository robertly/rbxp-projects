  The code sample below demonstrates one possible usage for the
  `Class.AnalyticsService:FireCustomEvent()|FireCustomEvent()` function, which
  can be used to fire a custom event for the `AnalyticsService`. In this
  example, the custom function is used to report that a new server has started,
  which would allow the developer to track data such as how many servers are
  started for their game.
