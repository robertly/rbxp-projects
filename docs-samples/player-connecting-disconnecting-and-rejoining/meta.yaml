"description": |
  This example demonstrates that the `Class.Players.PlayerConnecting`,
  `Class.Players.PlayerDisconnecting`, and `Class.Players.PlayerRejoining`
  events fire when a player connects to, disconnects from, and rejoins the game.
  Each of the events fires a message with the player name and the action. For
  example, when a player connects to the game, the PlayerConnecting event
  prints:

  > PlayerName connecting!

  This example will function as expected when executed in the command bar.
