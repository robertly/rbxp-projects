"description": |
  This code sample is meant for a `LocalScript` within an inner `Frame` that is
  inside an outer `Frame`, or other `GuiObject`. It allows the player to scale
  the inner frame by performing a `Class.GuiObject.TouchPinch` gesture on the
  outer frame.
"display_name": |-
  Pinch/Pull Scaling
"expected_output": |-
  When the player performs a pinch gesture, the inner frame should get smaller. When the player performs a pull gesture, the inner frame should get bigger. Note that if the inner frame renders text, there may be text rendering issues using a `UIScale`.
