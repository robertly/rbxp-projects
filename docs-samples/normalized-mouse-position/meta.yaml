  This code sample shows how you can create a `Datatype.Vector2` representing
  the `Mouse` object's position on screen (`Class.Mouse.X|X()` and
  `Class.Mouse.Y|Y()`) and the size of the screen itself
  (`Class.Mouse.ViewSizeX|ViewSizeX()` and `Class.Mouse.ViewSizeY|ViewSizeY()`).
  Using these, you can normalize the position of the mouse on-screen such that
  the top-left just under the topbar maps to (0, 0) and the bottom-right maps to
  (1, 1). This normalized position is calculated and printed as the mouse moves
  using the `Class.Mouse.Move|Move()` event.

  When run, moving your mouse will print its normalized position on-screen. Move your mouse toward the top left and you'll notice it gets closer to (0, 0). Move to the bottom right will get closer to (1, 1).
