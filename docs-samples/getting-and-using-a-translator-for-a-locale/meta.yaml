  This code sample attempts to retrieve a `Translator` object for the locale
  "fr" (French).

  `Class.LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForLocaleAsync()` is wrapped in a
  pcall because it may error. If it does not error and returns a Translator,
  prints "Hello in French:" followed by the French translation of "Hello
  World!". If the function errors, it prints "GetTranslatorForLocaleAsync
  failed:" followed by the error message.
