  The example demonstrates how to enable and disabled whether a player can lock
  their mouse.

  In this example, we set the use a while true loop to toggle the state of the
  DevEnabledMouseLock property between _true_ and _false_ every 5 seconds. While
  this example has little practical use, it demos how to change the property via
  a `LocalScript`.
