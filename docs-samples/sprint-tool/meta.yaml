  The code sample below creates `Tool` in the
  `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's` `Class.Backpack` that increases the
  player's `Class.Humanoid.Walkspeed|WalkSpeed` from `16` to `30` for 5 seconds.

  This example uses the tool's `Class.Tool.ManualActivationOnly` property as a
  debounce by setting the property to true when the player begins sprinting and
  to false when the player stops sprinting. As a result, when the player is
  sprinting the tool cannot be activated by pressing the left mouse button.

  Unequipping the tool also stops the player from sprinting by changing the
  WalkSpeed to `16`.
