  When placed inside a `Class.Player.Character` model this code will give a
  player the 'Midas touch'. Everything their character touches will change to
  gold.

  When the `Humanoid` dies, this change is undone and the golden
  `BasePart|BaseParts` are returned to their original state.

  To test this out, place this code inside a `Script` and place it in
  `StarterCharacterScripts|StarterPlayer.StarterCharacterScripts`.
