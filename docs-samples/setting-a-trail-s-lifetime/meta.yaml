  This example demonstrates the effects of setting and changing a trail's
  Lifetime property.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we alternate between a trail Lifetime of 0.5 and 5.5 seconds
  by switching between the two values every 5 seconds.

  Finally, to demo the property's affect on the trail's lifetime, the example
  relies on `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back
  and forth to continuously drawn a trail.
