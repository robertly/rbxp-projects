  Demonstrates the following:

  1. Connecting to the `Class.Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded` event upon the player joining which fires once all accessories have loaded
  2. Getting the amount the player's accessories by referencing the player's humanoid and calling `Class.Humanoid:GetAccessories()`
  3. Removing all accessories from the humanoid with `Class.Humanoid:RemoveAccessories()`
  4. Storing the connection per player and disconnecting when the player is removed to prevent a memory leak

  When a player joins and their character's appearance has loaded, the player's name and how many accessories they have will print. Then the accessories are removed from the player's humanoid.
