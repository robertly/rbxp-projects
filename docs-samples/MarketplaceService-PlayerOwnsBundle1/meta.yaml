  This code sample demonstrates how to check if a player owns a certain bundle.
  Here, we're checking for the bundle
  [Junkbot](https://www.roblox.com/bundles/589/Junkbot). As a player enters the
  game, their account is checked for the ownership of that item and a message is
  printed.

  Notice that a `pcall()` wraps the call to
  `MarketplaceService:PlayerOwnsBundle()` to prevent the code from throwing an
  error in case the player's inventory can't be checked. If such an error
  occurs, the `success` variable is false.
