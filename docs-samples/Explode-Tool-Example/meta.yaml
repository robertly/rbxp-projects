  This code is meant to be placed in a Script within a Tool. It allows a player
  to spawn explosions by equipping the tool and clicking on the ground. It does
  so by defining a function, `explode`, which creates a non-deadly explosion at
  a given point. Then, it defines a function, `onActivated`, that runs when the
  tool is activated. Finally, it connects the Activated event of the tool to the
  `onActivated` function.

  To test this code out, try creating a Tool and put a Part inside it. Name the
  Part "Handle". Put a Script inside the Tool next, and paste the code into it.
  Finally, put the Tool in the StarterPack.
