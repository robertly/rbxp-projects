  The following code sample creates a `LocalizationTable`, sets its entries,
  then gets and displays its entries. In order for this example to work, a
  LocalizationTable instance must be located inside the `LocalizationService`
  service.

  The _entries_ variable is a table of dictionaries, each with the format
  required to create a LocalizationTable with
  `Class.LocalizationTable:SetEntries()`.

  The _get_results_ variable is a table of dictionaries - the same table that we
  created with the _entries_ variable. We then loop through each of the tables
  in this dictionary to display its _Values_/strings.
