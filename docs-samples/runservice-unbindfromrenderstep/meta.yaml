  This example uses the `RunService` to bind and unbind a function named
  `printHello`. First, we bind the function to the RenderStep so that fires
  every _step_. Then, after we wait 5 seconds (`wait(5)`), we unbind the
  function.

  Please note that we take caution to surround the function unbind in a
  `pcall()` to prevent the code from breaking due to an error being thrown if
  the function name passed does not match the name of an already bound function.
  While we know that the function used in this example is bound when we try to
  unbind it, doing this is good coding practice.
