  This code sample uses HttpService's GetAsync to make a request to an endpoint
  at [Open Notify](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/), a
  website that provides information from NASA. The endpoint provides information
  on the current location of the International Space Station. This example uses
  a **defensive coding technique** that you should use when making web requests.
  It wraps the call to GetAsync and JSONDecode in pcall, which protects our
  script from raising an error if either of these fail. Then, it checks the raw
  response for all proper data before using it. All of this is put inside a
  function that returns true or false depending of the request's success.

  Whenever you're working with web requests, you should prepare for anything to
  go wrong. Perhaps your web endpoint changes or goes down - you don't want your
  game scripts raising errors and breaking your game. You want to handle both
  success **and failure** gracefully - have a plan in case your data is not
  available. Use `pcall` and make plenty of validity checks (if statements) on
  your data to make sure you're getting exactly what you expect.
