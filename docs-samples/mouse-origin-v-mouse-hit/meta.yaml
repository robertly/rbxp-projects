  The code below visualizes the difference between `Class.Mouse.Hit` and
  `Class.Mouse.Origin`. In order to do this, the code uses the
  `Datatype.Vector3` positions of the hit and origin `Datatype.CFrame` values
  using `.p`.

  The difference is that the origin is "where the mouse came from" (its origin)
  and the hit is the position where the mouse hits (is when the player presses
  their mouse).

  This example also visualizes that the mouse origin is very similar to the
  position of the `CurrentCamera` by printing the magnitude (distance) between
  the two positions.
