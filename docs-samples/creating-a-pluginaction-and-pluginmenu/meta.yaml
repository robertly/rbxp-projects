  This code sample visualizes how `PluginMenu|PluginMenus` and
  `PluginAction|PluginActions` behave when created for a `Plugin`. Outside of
  this example, you should not parent the plugin or its functional components to
  the game's workspace.

  In order to work as expected, the code block must but pasted into the command
  bar, but only once. Consecutive attempts at executing the code in the command
  bar will result in an error because a plugin cannot create more than one
  PluginMenu with the same id.

  After executing the code, changing the created `BoolValue` in the game's
  workspace via the Explorer window opens the plugin's menus. Selecting an
  action from the menus the function connected to the trigger signal.
