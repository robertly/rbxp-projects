  This example demos setting a trail's max length.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we initially set the trail's max length to 8. Then, to
  demonstrate the effects of changing the trail length, we alternate between a
  trail length of 2 and 8 every 5 seconds by adding and subtracting 6 from the
  length.

  In order to best demonstrate the effect of max length, and how it will limit
  how long a trail is before old segments are erased, the example sets the
  `Class.Trail.Lifetime` of the trail to 10. Since the lifetime allows for a
  trail much longer than 2 and 8, the example demonstrates the full effects of
  changing the max length property.

  Finally, to demo the trail's length constraint the example relies on
  `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth.
  As the part moves, the trail is drawn.
