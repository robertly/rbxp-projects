  This example demonstrates one possible usage of the
  `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` property.

  The example below respawns all players in the game, if dead, once every 10
  seconds. This means that players who die 1 second after all players respawn
  must wait 9 seconds until the script loads all `Class.Player.Character` again.

  First, this script removes a player's character when they die and the
  `Class.Humanoid.Died` function fires. This is done so that the respawn loop
  that executes every 10 seconds reloads that player when it does not find the
  player's character in the Workspace.

  To work as expected, this example should be run within a `Script`.
