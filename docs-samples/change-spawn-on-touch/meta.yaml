  This code sample will set the player to always respawn from the last
  SpawnLocation they touched. New players will respawn from the SpawnLocation
  named 'FirstSpawn' until they touch a different SpawnLocation.

  This is an alternative to using the AllowTeamChangeOnTouch property to switch
  SpawnLocations and does not require Teams.
