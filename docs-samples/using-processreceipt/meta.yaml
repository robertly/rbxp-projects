  This code sample illustrates a
  `Class.MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt|ProcessReceipt()` callback function
  for a game to handle purchasing of two developer products (you can add more as
  needed). It properly checks for and records purchases using a
  `GlobalDataStore` called "PurchaseHistory."

  Most importantly, it properly returns
  `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted` when the transaction is
  successfully completed **or** if it's detected that the purchase has already
  been granted using the "PurchaseHistory" data store.
