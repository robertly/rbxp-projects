  The example below demonstrates how to create a `Path` and it's
  `Datatype.PathWaypoint|PathWaypoints` using the `PathService`.

  It tries to `Class.Path:ComputeAsync()` a path between two `Datatype.Vector3`
  positions, from pathStart to pathEnd. If a path is successfully created,
  indicated by it's `Enum.PathStatus`, the code block gets an array of its
  waypoints using `Class.Path:GetWaypoints()`. Then, it loops through the array
  and prints each waypoint's position.
