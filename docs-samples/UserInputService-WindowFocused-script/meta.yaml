  This example fires a `Class.RemoteEvent:FireServer()|RemoveEvent` to the
  server name _AfkEvent_ when the `LocalPlayer`'s client gains or loses focus.

  The purpose of this code sample is to fire a server-side event to indicate
  when the player is AFK. This is indicated by spawning a `ForceField` around
  the player when the client loses focus and
  `Class.Instance:Destroy()|destroying` the forcefield when the client gains
  focus.

  In order for this example to work as expected, the code labelled _LocalScript_
  must be placed in a `LocalScript` and the code labelled _Script_ must be
  placed in a `Script`. This sample is a Script which should be run in
  conjunction with the LocalScript code sample: Window Focus AFK Script
