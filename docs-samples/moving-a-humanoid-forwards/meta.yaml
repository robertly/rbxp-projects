  This code sample uses the `Class.Humanoid:Move()` function to make the
  `Player|Player's` `Class.Player.Character|Character()` to walk in the
  direction of the `Camera`.

  `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` is required here as the default control
  scripts will overwrite the player's movement every frame.

  To run this sample, place it inside a `LocalScript` parented to
  `StarterCharacterScripts|StarterPlayer.StarterCharacterScripts`.
