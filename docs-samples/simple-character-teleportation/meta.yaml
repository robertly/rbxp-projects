  This code sample is a simple teleport script that moves your character
  10&nbsp;studs forwards in the direction you're currently facing when you press
  the <kbd>F</kbd> key. It does so by getting the current pivot with
  `Class.PVInstance:GetPivot()` and calling `PVInstance|PivotTo` to move the
  character forwards.
