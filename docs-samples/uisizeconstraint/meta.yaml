  This example creates a new anchored `ScreenGui`. It then creates a `Frame` and
  sets its parent to the created ScreenGui.

  Then, it creates a new UISizeConstraint with a MaxSize of `{250, 250}` and
  MinSize of `{50, 50}`. To display the functionality of this constraint, we
  then set the size of the Frame we created to `{(0, 400), (0, 400)}`. Due to
  the constraint, the Frame will only scale to `{(0, 250), (0, 250)}` instead of
  the set size.

  Please note that you can easily change the constraints in the example below to
  adjust the MaxSize and MinSize constraints on Frame set by the code.
