  This code sample demonstrates binding an "Inspect" action to a touch button
  created automatically by `ContextActionService`. The button is customized
  using `Class.ContextActionService:SetImage()|SetImage()`,
  `Class.ContextActionService:SetTitle()|SetTitle()`,
  `Class.ContextActionService:SetDescription()|SetDescription()` and
  `Class.ContextActionService:SetPosition()|SetPosition()`. The button is
  further customized by using
  `Class.ContextActionService:GetButton()|GetButton()` to get a reference to the
  `ImageButton` itself and tinting it green by setting
  `Class.ImageButton.ImageColor3`.

  Paste this code into a `LocalScript` placed within `StarterPlayerScripts` to
  test it. In Studio, be sure to toggle the touch device emulator in order for
  the button to actually be created.
