  This example alternates between setting a trail's minimum length of a trail to
  `10` studs and `0.1` studs every 3 seconds.

  To best display the change in minimum trail length, we first set the
  `Class.Trail.Lifetime` of the trail to 4. This means that the trail drawn will
  disappear 4 seconds after it is drawn.

  In order for this example to work as expected, the script containing this code
  must be a child of the trail. If you would like to place the code in a script
  that is not the child of the trail, you must change the `trail` value to point
  to the location of the trail object in the game.
