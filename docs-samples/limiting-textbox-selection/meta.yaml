  The example below offers a simple demonstration on how to use the
  `Class.GuiObject.Selectable` property to limit when a GUI element can be
  selected by the Gamepad navigator.

  When a `TextBox` has gains focus, it can be selected. However, when a TextBox
  loses focus it can no longer be selected.

  Although this is a simple demonstration, the property can also be used to
  prevent the navigator from selecting UI elements that exist for cosmetic
  rather than functional purposes. For instance, while the buttons on a menu
  screen should be selectable, the title image should not be.
