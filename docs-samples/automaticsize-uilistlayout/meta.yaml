  The following script creates an automatically-sized parent frame with
  a`UIListLayout`, then it inserts several automatically-sized `TextLabel`
  objects. Note how the parent `UIListLayout` automatically resizes to fit its
  child content and the labels automatically resize to fit their text content.
  This script can be parented to a `ScreenGui`.
