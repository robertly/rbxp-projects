  The following code will print "[PlayerName] hovered over my parent!" when a player's cursor hovers over the `Class.ClickDetector` parent. It will also print "[PlayerName] hovered off my parent!" when the player's cursor moves off the `Class.ClickDetector` parent.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it must be placed in a `Script` or `LocalScript` whose parent is a `Class.ClickDetector`.
