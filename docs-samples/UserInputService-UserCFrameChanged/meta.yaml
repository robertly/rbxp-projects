  This example demonstrates how to implement a head tracking script that mirrors
  the movement of a virtual reality (VR) headset (the user's actual head) to
  their in-game `Class.Player.Character|character's` head.

  The example first check if the user is using a VR device by checking the value
  of the `Class.UserInputService.VREnabled|VREnabled()` property. This example
  only works if the user is using a VR headset.

  To determine the initial `Datatype.CFrame` of the character's head, the code
  sample calls `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()|GetUserCFrame()` and
  passes `Enum.UserCFrame.Head` as the argument.

  To update the head's CFrame whenever the user's VR headset moves, the example
  connects the `Class.UserInputService.UserCFrameChanged` event to the
  _TrackHead()_ function. When the event fires to indicate that a VR device
  moved, TrackHead() checks if the headset moved. If the headset moved, the
  function updates the CFrame of the character's head to the `Datatype.CFrame`
  _value_ provided as an argument.

  As the UserCFrame enum also tracks VR left and right hand devices, the concept
  of VR device tracking can be expanded to other character bodyparts.

  In order for the example to work as expected, it must be placed in a
  `LocalScript`.
