  This code sample includes a function that avoids the 8 second timeout on
  `Class.Humanoid:MoveTo()` by calling `Class.Humanoid:MoveTo()` again before
  the timeout elapses. It also includes an optional _andThen_ parameter where
  developers can pass a function to be called when the humanoid reaches its
  destination.
