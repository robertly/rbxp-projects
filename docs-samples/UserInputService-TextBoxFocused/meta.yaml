  This example adjusts the `Class.GuiObject.Transparency|transparency` of
  `TextBox|TextBoxes` when they gain and lose focus using.

  When a text box `Class.UserInputService.TextBoxFocused|gains focus`, it's
  transparency deceases. When a text box
  `Class.UserInputService.TextBoxFocusReleased|loses focus`, it's transparency
  increases. This is similar to how the default chat window increases and
  decreases transparency when a user starts and stops interacting with it.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it should be placed in a
  `LocalScript`.
