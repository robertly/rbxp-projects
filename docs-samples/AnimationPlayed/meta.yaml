  The following code sample includes a function that prints the name of an
  animation whenever an AnimationTrack plays on a humanoid.

  A connection is made listening to the Humanoid.AnimationPlayed and the name of
  the underlying animation is printed.

  Please note that AnimationPlayed is a member of both Humanoid and
  AnimationController which this example would also work on.
