  This code sample includes a demonstration of tween conflict. A part is
  instanced in the Workspace, and two tweens are created that attempt to move
  the part in conflicting directions.

  When both tweens are played, the first tween is cancelled and overwritten by
  the second tween. This can be seen as the part moves along the Y axis as
  opposed to the Z axis.

  To further demonstrate this, connections have been made for both tweens to the
  Tween.Completed event. Upon playing the tweens, the following is printed.

  tween1: Enum.PlaybackState.Cancelled tween2: Enum.PlaybackState.Completed

  These prints show that the first tween was cancelled (firing the Completed
  event) immediately upon the second tween being played. The second tween then
  went on to play until completion.
