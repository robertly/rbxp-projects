  This code sample gives an example [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format string
  and parses it using HttpService's JSONDecode. It then verifies that the JSON
  was parsed correctly, and prints out some of the information within the
  object.

  Try editing the JSON string to experiment with the format. Also experiment
  with inspecting the data in Lua to get comfortable with the Lua representation
  of the data (tables and other values).
