  This code sample is for a Tool object with a Part named Handle. It detects
  when Humanoids other than the current holder hit the handle, and deals some
  damage to them. In addition, when the Tool is activated, it triggers a slash
  animation in the default character animation scripts. Try out this script by
  creating a Tool object in the StarterPack. Put a Part inside it, and name it
  Handle. Paste this code into a Script inside the Tool, then try slashing at
  another Humanoid!
