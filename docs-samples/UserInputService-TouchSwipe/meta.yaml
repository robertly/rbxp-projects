  The example below demonstrates the
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchSwipe|TouchSwipe()` event by
  `Class.GuiObject:TweenPosition()|tweening` a `GuiObject|GUI` element's
  position 100 pixels in the direction of the swipe according to the value of
  the `Enum.SwipeDirection|swipeDirection` argument.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it must be placed in a
  `LocalScript` that is parented to the gui being swiped.
