  This code sample contains demonstrates when the Sound.IsPlaying and
  Sound.IsPaused properties will be true or false.

  A sound is instanced in the Workspace and the Sound.IsLoaded property is
  checked to ensure it has loaded, if it has not the Sound.Loaded event is used
  to yield the script until the sound has.

  As the sound is played, paused and stopped the Sound.IsPlaying and
  Sound.IsPaused properties are printed to demonstrate how they respond to each
  of these functions. Note Sound.IsPaused will always be true if even if the
  sound has been stopped rather than paused.
