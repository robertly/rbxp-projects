  This example demos the functionality of trails.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we set the `Class.Trail.Color` to a fade between blue and
  white using a `Datatype.ColorSequence`. For more info on how to set a trail's
  color in a script, see the `Class.Trail.Color`'s documentation.

  Finally, to demo the alignment the example relies on `TweenService`'s
  `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back and forth. As the part
  moves, the trail is drawn.
