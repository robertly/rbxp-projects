  This sample demonstrates how Sound.TimePosition can be used to jump to
  particular points in an audio file both before and during Sound playback.

  A Sound is created in the Workspace and set to start at 30 seconds in. During
  playback, it jumps forwards to 100 seconds and then back to the start (0
  seconds).
