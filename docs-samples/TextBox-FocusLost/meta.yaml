  This example works when placed in a `Class.LocalScript` that is the child of a
  TextBox. When the TextBox loses focus, the example prints either:

  1. "Player pressed Enter" - if the TextBox lost focus because the player
     pressed the Enter key. **_or_**
  2. "Player pressed InputObject._KeyCode_" - where "_KeyCode_" is the
     `Class.InputObject` KeyCode property of the input that caused the TextBox
     to lose focus. For example, pressing the Escape (esc) key to exit TextBox
     focus returns an InputObject instance with the KeyCode
     'InputObject.Escape'.
