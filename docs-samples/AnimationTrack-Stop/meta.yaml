  This code sample includes a function that stops an AnimationTrack with a
  specific fadeTime, and yields until the fade is completed and the weight of
  the AnimationTrack is equal to zero.

  The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how the fadeTime parameter of
  AnimationTrack.Stop works. In most cases, if a developer wishes to yield over
  the fadeTime it is recommended they use wait(fadeTime).
