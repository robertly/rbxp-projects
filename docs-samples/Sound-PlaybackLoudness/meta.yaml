  In this sample Sound.PlaybackLoudness is used to create an amplitude bar that
  shows the amplitude of a sound playing.

  This code sample should be placed in StarterPlayerScripts.

  A simple GUI is created, a frame holding that bar and a frame containing the
  bar. A Sound is then played and the size of the bar is set to reflect the
  Sound.PlaybackLoudness on a loop.
