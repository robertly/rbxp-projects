  This code adds a force on a part so that it falls in the direction of actual
  gravity relative to the user's device.

  In order for this example to work as expected, it must be placed in a
  `LocalScript` and the user's device must have an
  `Class.UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled|accelerometer`.
