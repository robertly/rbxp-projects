  This example demonstrates the effects of setting and changing a trail's
  WidthScale property.

  In order to do this, we must first create a `BasePart`, _part_, which will be
  the parent of the trail.

  Then, we create two attachments, _attachment0_ and _attachment1_, both
  parented to _part_. The positions of these two attachments, more importantly
  the distance between them, determines where the trail is drawn as _part_
  moves. It is this distance that used with the WidthScale value to determine
  the width of the trail's drawn segments.

  For these attachments to create a trail as described, we create a new Trail
  and parent it to _part_. We then connect _attachment0_ to
  `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and _attachment1_ to `Class.Trail.Attachment1`.

  In this example, we rely on an array containing two values
  `sizes = {0.25, 0.75}` to alternate between two WidthScale properties. To
  alternate, we use a variable `i` and the formula `(i+1)%2` to flip the value
  of `i` between `0` and `1`. Lastly, we set the WidthScale value using a
  `Datatype.NumberSequence` to set the property to the `ith` element (1 or 2)
  from `sizes`.

  Finally, to demo the property's affect on the trail's lifetime, the example
  relies on `TweenService`'s `Class.TweenService:Create()` to move _part_ back
  and forth. As the part moves, the trail's segment lifetime (existing and new)
  grows and shrinks as the property changes.
