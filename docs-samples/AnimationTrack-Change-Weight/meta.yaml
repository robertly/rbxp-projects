  This code sample includes a function that changes the weight of an
  AnimationTrack and yields until the weight has changed to the new target
  weight.

  The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how the fadeTime parameter of
  AnimationTrack.ChangeWeight works. In most cases, if a developer wishes to
  yield over the fadeTime it is recommended they use wait(fadeTime).
