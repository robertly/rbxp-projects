  The code in this sample, when placed inside a `LocalScript` within
  `StarterPlayerScripts` will draw a red laser beam between the character's head
  and `Class.Mouse.Hit` at all times.

  Note, this beam will pass directly through obstructions in third person as the
  `Mouse`'s raycasting is done from the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` not the
  head.
