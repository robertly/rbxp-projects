  This code sample demonstrates how to toggle whether mouse lock is available to
  a player using a chat command. When a player types "mouselock", their ability
  to toggle mouse lock is toggled. Note that this does **not** toggle the actual
  state of mouse lock; rather, it changes whether a player is **able** to toggle
  it themselves.

  This code can be run by pasting it into a `Script` within
  `ServerScriptService`.
