  This example properly shows how to use ContextActionService in binding user
  input to a contextual action. The context is the tool being equipped; the
  action is reloading some weapon. Test this code sample by placing it in a
  LocalScript parented to a Tool. When the Tool is equipped, a "Reload" action
  is bound, and when the Tool is unequipped the "Reload" action is unbound. When
  the player presses R with the Tool equipped, the message "Reloading!" will
  appear.
