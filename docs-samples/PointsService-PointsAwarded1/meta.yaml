  When a player is awarded points successfully the below example would print the
  userId and their new point balance. If, for example, the Roblox account was
  awarded thirty points (and had none to begin with) "User: 1 has now earned 30
  (+30) points in the current game, now making their total balance 30" would be
  printed.
