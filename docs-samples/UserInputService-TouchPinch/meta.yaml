  By default, Roblox relies on a `LocalScript` to control the user's camera.
  However, this script can be overridden with a custom _CameraScript_. The
  example below demonstrates how to create a custom script to control the user's
  camera using many of the `UserInputService` events.

  The script is broken into two parts:

  1. Mobile camera events, which rely on touch events
  2. Non-mobile camera events, which rely on keyboard input and tracking the
     user's movement

  First, the camera script needs utility functions to setup the camera and set
  its `Class.Camera.CameraType` to _Scriptable_ so that the script can control
  the camera. It also needs a function to update the camera when it moves,
  rotates, and zooms.

  Using touch events allows us to track user input as they interact with the
  touchscreen on their mobile device. These events allow us to handle camera
  movement, rotation, and zoom.

  The second half of the code sample adds camera support for players on desktop
  devices. When input begans, the function Input() checks that the state of the
  input is `Enum.UserInputState.Begin` to ignore all keypress inputs other than
  when the user first presses a key down. When the user presses _I_ and _O_ the
  camera zooms in and out. When the presses down and moves their left mouse
  button, the script `Enum.MouseBehavior|locks` the player's mouse by changing
  the `Class.UserInputService.MouseBehavior` property. The camera rotates
  according to the mouse's
  `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|change in screen position`. When the
  player moves their character, the camera moves with them.

  All of the parts discussed above are combined and shown in the code sample
  below.
