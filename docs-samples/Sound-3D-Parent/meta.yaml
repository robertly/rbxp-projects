  The code in this sample demonstrates how a sound parented to a Part or
  Attachment will play locally and experience volume drop off the further the
  player's camera is away from the part.

  A part is instanced, and a sound is instanced and parented to the part. A
  click detector is set up on the part that will check if the sound is playing,
  using `Class.Sound.IsPlaying` and play or stop the sound depending.
