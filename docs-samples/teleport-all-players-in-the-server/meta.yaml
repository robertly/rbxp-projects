  This code sample is an example of how
  `Class.TeleportService:TeleportPartyAsync()` can be used to teleport a group
  of `Player|Players`.

  In this case, all `Player|Players` will be teleported to the specified
  _placeId_ as a party. The `Class.DataModel.JobId` of the destination server is
  then printed.
