  This sample demonstrates how the playback of a tween can be paused and
  resumed.

  A part is instanced in the Workspace and a tween is setup that will move it 50
  studs along the X axis. However during playback the tween is briefly paused,
  then resumed. To further illustrate this the BrickColor of the part changes
  from red to green while it is paused.
