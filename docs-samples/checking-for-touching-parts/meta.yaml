  The code block below demonstrates how to use
  `Class.WorldRoot:ArePartsTouchingOthers()` to check if parts in a list are
  touching any parts in the workspace not in the list.

  First the script creates two square parts that overlap 1 stud, `Part1` and
  `Part2`. Then, it prints the value returned by ArePartsTouchingOthers() when
  Part1 is passed in `partList` at three different overlap values: `0`, `0.999`,
  and `1`. The first two times ArePartsTouchingOthers() is called return `false`
  because the overlap values are less than the distance that Part1 and Part2
  overlap. The third call returns `true` because the overlap value is equal to
  the distance that the parts overlap.
