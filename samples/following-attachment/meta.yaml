display_name: Model Following a Player
description: |
  The FollowingAttachment module creates an attachment that trails on the ground at some max distance behind a player's character.

  DemoScript uses constraints to align a rock part's position and orientation with the attachment such that the rock follows each player's character.

  The attachment stops updating and the rock is destroyed when the character dies.
